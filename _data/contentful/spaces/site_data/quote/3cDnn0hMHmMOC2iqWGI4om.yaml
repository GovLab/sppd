text: What sort of personality makes for an effective data scientist? Definitely curiosityâ€¦.
  __The biggest question in data science is 'Why?'__ Why is this happening? If you
  notice that there's a pattern, ask, 'Why?' Is there something wrong with the data
  or is this an actual pattern going on? Can we conclude anything from this pattern?
  A natural curiosity will definitely give you a good foundation.
