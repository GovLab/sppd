title: 'Introduction to Evidence-Based Decision-Making: Examples in Economic Development'
duration: 40
description: 'If you invest in things that do not work rather than those that do,
  real people’s lives may be affected in dramatic ways. However, how do you know what
  works? Through real-world examples and contemporary debates (e.g., the expansion
  of health insurance, or  crime and violence prevention), you will understand the
  basic principles of evidence-based decision making, how this relates to “counterfactual”
  reasoning, and frameworks for thinking about how to apply rigorous, scientifically-based
  methods to solve problems in ways that are  both effective and cost-effective. '

  description: Utilize the [Methods Guides](http://egap.org/list-methods-guides) and
    online experimental Tools written by [Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP)](http://egap.org/).
    These guides provide both technical and non-technical discussions on challenges
    commonly faced in causal inference, why randomization is important to experimental
    design and causal attribution, but also cases when of non-experimental designs
    may lead to causal insights. Example code, written in the R programming language,
    is accessible here online, as well as example vignettes.
