title: 'Data Analytical Thinking and Methods I: How To Define a Research Question
  and Introduction to Statistical Approaches to Draw Inference'
duration: 42
description: 'During this session you will learn about quantitative data—including
  so-called "big data"— and some of the statistical techniques researchers and policy
  officials  use  to derive value from it. The lecture emphasizes  the broad structure
  and necessary steps  needed in any data-related inquiry: define a research question,
  formulate a testable hypothesis,  think about what data is available, what data
  is missing, issues of measurement error, and other applied concerns, such as how
  to  link datasets. At the end, we will discuss some of the statistical paradigms  that
  can be used to draw inferences, as well as some of the key ideas when addressing
  the privacy and confidentiality issues.'
