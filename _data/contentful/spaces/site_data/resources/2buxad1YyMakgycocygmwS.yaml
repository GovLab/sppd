description: Utilize the [Methods Guides](http://egap.org/list-methods-guides) and
  online experimental Tools written by [Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP)](http://egap.org/).
  These guides provide both technical and non-technical discussions on challenges
  commonly faced in causal inference, why randomization is important to experimental
  design and causal attribution, but also cases when of non-experimental designs may
  lead to causal insights. Example code, written in the R programming language, is
  accessible here online, as well as example vignettes.
